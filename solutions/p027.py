    """
    Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: $n^2 + n + 41$ It turns
    out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer
    values 0 <= n <= 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1)
    + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is
    clearly divisible by 41. The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was
    discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0 <= n <=
    79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479. Considering
    quadratics of the form:  n^2 + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| <=
    1000 where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11| = 11 and
    |-4| = 4  Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the
    quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for
    consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.

        When you research Euler's polynomial as stated in the problem, you will quickly
        come across:
        http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Prime-GeneratingPolynomial.html
        The "incredible" formula n^2−79n+1601 can be rewritten as
        (n−40)^2+(n−40)+41=k^2+k+41 where k=(n−40). In other words, it is another
        transformation of Euler's prime-generating polynomial. If p(n) generates
        primes for 0≤n≤L, then so does p(L−n).
        p(n)=n^2+n+41
        p(L−n)=(L−n)^2+(L−n)+41
        p(L−n)=n^2−2Ln−n+L^2+L+41
        p(L−n)=n^2−(2L+1)n+p(L)
        p(L−n)=n^2+an+b
        where a=−(2L+1) and b=L^2+L+41

        We also know that when n=0, p(0)=0^2+0a+b=b. Since p(n) needs to generate
        positive primes, this means b is a positive prime. According to the problem
        statement, we only care about b<1000. Therefore:

        b=L^2+L+41<1000⟹−31≤L≤30 in terms of integer solutions.

        We want the longest run of primes, which corresponds to the largest b possible
        here. Thus, we take L to be 30, which makes b equal to 30^2+30+41=971 and a
        equal to −(2(30)+1)=−61.

        Therefore:
        a=−61,b=971

        The answer is ab=(−61)(971)=−59231

        The following code solves for the maximum L value based on the limit you pass
        into the function, and returns the corresponding product of a and b.
